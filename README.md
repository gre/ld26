Ludum Dare 26, "Minimalism"
=====================================

For this game jam, I've decided to make a minimalist multiplayer game.

The game
--------

Try to touch the other players without being touched.

Technology
-------

The game is a web application with:

* CSS + HTML + Canvas (Javascript)
* Play framework 2.1.1 (Scala)
* WebSocket
* Akka

Target
-----

**Desktop, Mobile and Tablets !**
